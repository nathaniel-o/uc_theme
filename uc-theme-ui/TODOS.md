        ## GUIDELINE DECISIONS

 - Garnishes in Post-content should have prefixes with dashes e.g. Garnish: Fruit - Citrus
    Colors: Red / orange / green ( Slashes okay, capitalize first only)

        ## LEARNED

Search Bar does read Posts' Content

        ## TODOS:
- [ ]Remove -time suffix from category names (WHERE applicable?)

- [ ] Fix duplicate titles in existing posts? i.e. those before 29 July need manual review ??
